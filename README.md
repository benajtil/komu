KOMU 📍

A location-based community communication platform

Overview

KOMU (short for Komunikasyon) is a community-driven application designed to help people within the same barangay communicate, collaborate, and engage in meaningful local discussions.
Unlike traditional social platforms, KOMU restricts access by location—ensuring conversations stay private, relevant, and community-focused.

Problem

Local communities often rely on fragmented platforms (Facebook groups, group chats, word of mouth) that:
Lack privacy and moderation
Allow outsiders to view or interfere
Are not designed for structured community discussions

Solution

KOMU provides a location-restricted communication space where only verified residents of a barangay can:
Share announcements
Discuss local concerns and politics

Submit suggestions and feedback

Participate in polls and community discussions

Key Features

Barangay-based access control
Private, location-restricted discussions
Community announcements & forums
Polling & suggestions system
Mobile-first, user-friendly interface
Offline-first support (planned)
